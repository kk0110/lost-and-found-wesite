                    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px;">Email Matching Service</p>
                    LostAndFound.com offers a matching service that "matches" the consumer's lost database ad with information entered into our found database by other users. Closely relevant results are sent by email to the consumer, who can view the found ad to determine its pertinence.<br>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px;">Reward Incentive</p>
                    LostAndFound.com believes that providing an incentive by offering a reward for lost pets or property is an important instrument for recovery. Particularly today, when one can measure the value of lost data as greater than the economic value of the device that contains it, a reward can be the paramount motive for recovery. Not to mention the sentimental value of a lost pet! LostAndFound.com provides consumers with the ability to put a reward icon on the results page, and provides the reward amount on the ad details page. The consumer is responsible for the reward.<br>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px;">Photos</p>
                    They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In terms of identifying a pet or piece of property, a photograph provides essential information that words cannot convey. Consumers can upload a photo for use with their ad on the Ad Detail Page, the Ad Results Page, or as a "Featured Ad". (see below)<br>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px; background: #CFE3FE; padding: 10px;">Ad Enhancements</p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px;">Highlighting and Bolding</p>
                    Consumers can <span style="background-color: yellow;">highlight</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px;">bold</span> their lost ad on the Results Page to make their ad stand out.<br>

                    Consumers can have their lost ad placed at the top of the Results Page for all local search queries.<br>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px;">Featured Ad Homepage</p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7-px; background: #CFE3FE; padding: 10px;">Venues</p>
                    LostAndFound.com offers a venue page for public locations to effectively create an "online lost and found box".  Rather than have searchers peruse listings for a whole city or country, the Venue Page allows individual locations to set up their own lost and found information online. This information is blended with the main database for all universal searches, however, only data specific to the venue is listed on the venue page. Venues can direct and report lost and found information quickly and efficiently using this tool.<br>
                    <br>
